# direct_mail_fundraising
Grad Project for Data Algorithms II

The Direct Mail Fundraising Competition was a final project for my Data Algorithims II course as part of my UTSA Masters in Data Analytics program. The goal of this project was to develop a classification model that could effectively capture donors so that the expected net profit was maximized as part of a nationa veteran's fundraising efforts.
The project consisted of the following:

* Ran various data algorithms using logistic regression, SVM's, random forests, decisions trees, and KNNs on 3,000 observations to predict who would donate to a fundraising campaign

* Was 1st place among my graduate peers in obtaining the highest prediction accuracy rate for the project as part of the modeling competition

* Performed data cleansing techniques such as removing outliers, standardizing data, and transforming variables to obtain an improved accuracy rate for the data set
